This algorithm searches for something equal to itself in a cryptographic way which may include itself.

set myHash to the hash of this algorithm.

FOREVER

  Create something which is the same size of this algorithm.
  Set hashOfSomething to the hash of something.
  Print hashOfSomething

  IF hashOfSomething is equal to myHash
    Wait FOREVER

END FOREVER
