This algorithm searches for something which is equal to nothing in a cryptograhpic way.

Set hashOfNothing to the hash of nothing.
Create something from zeros.

UNTIL hash of something is the same with hash of nothing, do:

		set hashOfSomething to the hash of something.
		increase something by one.

END UNTIL

Alert that something has been found
Create a flag so that we do not have to look for it anymore.
Stop
