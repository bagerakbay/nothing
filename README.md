four shell scripts written for four embedded systems on their own quests for nothing.


download and run, or, fork and appropriate these four works in the exhibition “blockchain is… / …for nothing” by peers at httpdot.net, organized by protocinema at aetopoulos, athens, february 2019



01.sh / "the quest for finding something that is nothing, or, the study of what nothing is not"

02.sh / "the study of the state of nothing: nothing is the same, or, nothing has changed"

03.sh / "a work of art on a quest for becoming an artist by appropriating itself as a work of art as the proof-of-work by the artist relying on its own proof as an original and authentic work of art" aka "proof-of-work-of-art-ist"

04.sh / "a blockchain for nothing"



"the study of the state of nothing: nothing is the same, or, nothing has changed"
by peers at httpdot.net, 2019, gnu gplv3


embedded system running a custom copyleft free/libre software on a quest for verifying the state of nothing by calculating hash of empty string, nothing, using various cryptographic hash functions and comparing them to known hash values of nothing, as an obsessive and persistent fixity check for the state of nothing executed once in every minute, and if there is no change, outputs “nothing is the same” on a command-line interface along with all its process, and outputs “nothing has changed”, if anything changes.

custom software is written as a bash script by bager akbay, along with the pseudocode, and released as a copyleft free/libre software under GNU GPLv3. 
all programs and utilities executed by bash script are also free/libre software.
the embedded system powered by a gnu/linux operating system is also programmed by bager akbay.
this work is commissioned by protocinema for the exhibition “blockchain is… / …for nothing” at aetopoulos, athens, february 2019



"the quest for finding something that is nothing, or, the study of what nothing is not"
by peers at httpdot.net, 2019, gnu gplv3


embedded system running a custom copyleft free/libre software on a quest for finding nothing by creating all possible values for a 256-bit of something one-by-one, which is a total of 115.792.089.237.316.195.423.570.985.008.687.907.853.269.984.665.640.564.039.457.584.007.913.129.639.936 things, and calculating their sha-256 cryptographic hashes to compare them to that of nothing for finding a match and thus finding nothing; or otherwise proves what nothing is not when hash of something does not match that of nothing, and displays the results on a command-line interface as well as all this process of a second-preimage attack on sha-256 hash of nothing as a brute-force cryptographic attack.

"a blockchain for nothing"
by peers at httpdot.net, 2019, gnu gplv3


embedded system running a custom copyleft free/libre software on a quest for creating a blockchain for nothing which originates from nothing and continuously building blocks, each of which consisting of nothing but the sha-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block, and displays all blocks created with no proof-of-work on a command-line interface one after another by keeping the record of nothing but the last block.

by peers at httpdot.net, 2019, gnu gplv3


embedded system running a custom copyleft free/libre software as a work of art on a quest for becoming an artist by duplicating and appropriating itself as a work of art by creating random data of its own size and displaying it for 15 seconds as a candidate for an artwork while calculating and comparing the hash of that random data to its own hash and continues this process until it finds a match as a proof of its duplicate as an appropriated work of art as a proof-of-work by the artist.
