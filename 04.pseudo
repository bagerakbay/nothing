This algorithm calculates hash of nothing and iterates the result to create the next hash.

Set genesisBlockTimeStamp to the current time.
Set blockHeight to zero
Set hashOftheBlock to the hash of nothing.

print genesisBlockTimeStamp

	set hashOftheBlock to the hash of hashOftheBlock.
	print hashOftheBlock
	raise blockHeight by one.
