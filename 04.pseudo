This algorithm calculates hash of nothing and iterates the result to create the next hash.

Set genesisBlockTimeStamp to the current time.
Set counter to zero
Set hashOftheBlock to the hash of nothing.

print genesisBlockTimeStamp

FOREVER

		set hashOftheBlock to the hash of hashOftheBlock.
		print hashOftheBlock
    raise counter by one.
    print counter

END FOREVER
